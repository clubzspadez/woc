She was the Village Manager of Lincoln Heights, Ohio, Municipal Manager for Woodlawn, Ohio, and the Vice President of Diversity and Social Services, Franciscan Health System. Upon her return to Massachusetts she worked for the Commonwealth as the Deputy Director of Homeowner Services, Neighborhood Housing Development, and functioned as the Superintendent of Bureau of State Office Buildings and finally was appointed the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance. In 2011, Carole and her family moved to North Attleboro, and she became the Division Director for Capital Asset Management and Maintenance for the State of Rhode Island.
            <br><br>
            Carole earned one of her master’s degrees from Cornell in American History/Urban and Regional Planning and a second master’s degree from George Washington University in American History.  She’s received an Honorary doctorate in Engineering Technology from the Wentworth Institute. 
             <br><br>
            Her entrepreneurial spirit led her to create Cornelison & Associates Consulting in Cincinnati, Ohio and in her spare time no matter where she was, she enjoyed educating others on African American History as an adjunct professor at University of Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky University, and Boston University.
             <br><br>
            Carole loved bringing people together and entertaining her friends. She was a spiritual person who invested her time in the community as well as each of her family members. Her no nonsense approach to life was complimented by her generosity which was boundless.
