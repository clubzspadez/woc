        <h2>History </h2>
      </div>
      <div class="info1">
        <br>
        <li>The Massachusetts of Color Coalition started in 2015 inspired by the vision of two women; Brenda Jenkins
          and Celia
          J. Blue.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Brenda Jenkins – was inspired by her efforts in support of Florcy Romero and Cheyenne Jones, two college
          students
          of color and campus organizers in the movement for Black lives. With the help of Brenda, Florcy and Cheyenne
          founded
          Women of Color in Solidarity- a network which connected female students of color across several local
          colleges
          and universities with seasoned women leaders/organizers of color to “dialogue about the responsibility that
          we
          uphold to advocate and protest for the rights of each other and our men of color.” From that powerful
          experience,
          Brenda developed a vision for bringing together an even larger intergenerational network of WOC in Worcester
          to
          learn about what was happening in our city and to get us more connected, engaged and invested. Brenda
          formally
          invited women to a networking breakfast in April 2015.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Celia Blue – inspired and empowered by her work as President of the North Central Massachusetts Minority
          Coalition,
          President of the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials, Boston and with her efforts in working with
          Mary
          Fernandes, Mukiya Baker Gomez and other leaders of color in the Boston area to make state government more
          inclusive,
          Celia realized not only should there continue to be a focus on people of color, but more importantly there
          needed
          to be a specific focus on WOC. She had a vision of organizing WOC across the commonwealth (and also has a
          global
          vision), but wanted to start with the commonwealth first, beginning with outreach into the 3 largest cities;
          Worcester,
          Springfield and Boston that geographically spanned the commonwealth. The plan was to initially invite a small
          group
          of WOC who were liked minded on WOC inequality issues to agree on the top 3- 5 areas of priority that would
          have
          significant impact and forming a movement to become one voice to change the status quo.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Worcester WOC – The networking breakfast sparked the conversation with sisters whom Brenda had a long
          history of
          organizing with – Maritza Cruz, Joyce McNickles, Marie Boone and Marianna Islam who saw the idea of a
          state-wide
          effort as an opportunity to build upon their collective work as racial justice organizers to grow an even
          deeper
          dialogue/movement – strictly focused on WOC. These women along with several other leaders of color in
          Worcester
          had just completed a report with specific recommendations to the city manager and mayor to make Worcester
          more
          inclusive. Encouraged and empowered by the reception of their report and work among other sisters across the
          state-
          outreach was made to trusted and experienced WOC organizers in the Boston and Springfield areas.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In May 2015 meetings begun to develop MAWOCC. Our name was created, vision, mission statement and statement of who we are were developed and the platforms we would focus on were determined.
          Our founding members are: Brenda Jenkins, Maritza
          Cruz,
          Marie Boone, Joyce McNickles, Marianna Islam, Waleska Lugo-DeJesus, Alysia Cutting Cosby, Denise Jordan,
          Mukiya
          Baker Gomez, Diane Wilkerson, Mary Fernandes, Chioma Nnaji and Celia Blue</li>
